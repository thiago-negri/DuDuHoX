* DuDuHoX

Making a maze game in order to learn Haskell.

** Progress

*** Working:
- Movement (W, A, S, D)
- Quitting (Q)
- Winning (Moving on top of '!')
- World parsing (DuDuHoX.World.Builder.parseWorld)
- Line of sight (DuDuHoX.Console.drawVision)

*** Things to do:
- Fog of war. 
  - Draw objects in sight and objects already seen in a different way.
  - Take a look at System.Console.ANSI SGR.
- Draw walkable floor.
  - More efficient data representation of World?
- World scrolling.
- Keys & doors.
